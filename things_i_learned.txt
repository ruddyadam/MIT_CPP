I learned that rand() acts differently than I would expect.  Every time you call rand(),
it uses the last seed.  Unless you manually change the seed, the sequence produced
by rand() will be the same each time the program is run.  So the answer is to set srand
to something like the current time since epoch in seconds.

I am learning more about passing variables by reference and using pointers in functions.
